testing handhelds in the drive-thru Rewards growth appreciated record growth thanks to a revamped multi-tender program nearly 23 million members\\nBy the time Q2 of 2021 rolled around in April Starbucks domestic same-store sales had fully recovered at 9 percent growthmeaningful improvement from negative 5 percent in Q1\\nAnd given the brands AI investments dubbed Deep Brew along with the asset transformation Starbucks firmly moved beyond the COVID hole and into a future filled with more potential than ever\\n3\\nChick-fil-A\\nAsk anybody in the Southeast what they thought of fast food and COVID and youll likely hear a tale about the never-ending drive-thru that didnt miss a beat Remember when social media thought Chick-fil-A should handle vaccinate distribution Unsurprisingly the brand found a way to shine during the pandemic famously erecting multiple-lane setups that managed to deliver the guest experience and hospitality Chick-fil-A built an empire on Cow-themed masks and all\\nIt started with giving back In April 2020 the chain announced a relief effort dedicated to helping local franchisees continue their support of those impacted by the crisis It was anchored by a 108 million fund Chick-fil-A corporate distributed to communities Funds were made available to operators through June 2020 with the intent to foster an immediate impact including food donations or items to first responders healthcare workers Chick-fil-A employees and their families\\nChick-fil-A then said in March 2021 it would invest 19 million in restaurant employees continuing education awarding college scholarships to 7492 team members in 44 states Washington DC and Canada More recent developments include a robotic delivery test and the creation of a delivery-only concept set to debut in Nashville\\nAdditionally Chick-fil-A continues to explore modular constructionthe first such store opened outside of Atlanta last Octoberand is showing zero signs of slowing down sales wise unit growth or anything else\\n4\\nTaco Bell\\nDue to its breakfast service and late-night prowess Taco Bell had a steeper climb during COVID than its big-chain Yum! Brands counterparts Pizza Hut and KFC the company also owns fast casual Habit Burger Same-store sales declined 8 percent in Q2 off a 7 percent gain in the year-ago period Temporary closures climbed as high as 500 at the end of the first period with 100 locations reopening by mid-April\\nBut thats not to say Taco Bell didnt score some major wins during the COVID-laced year Its digital business reached 1 billion and mixed 12 percent in Q4 while delivery ran in the high-single digits Taco Bell also appreciated record-drive thru performance and achieved transaction times below four minutes with the fastest times recorded in Q4 despite added volume\\nTaco Bell became the first of Yum!s chains to test an advanced point-of-sale system described as a modern tablet-based application thats completely customizable\\nAll that said the most visible moments of 2020 and into 2021 for Taco Bell have come with store models Taco Bell unveiled a fully digital Times Square store in April that includes 15 glowing order-ahead pickup cubbies and 10 kiosks to replace traditional analog menuboards Additionally the chain shared a plan to diversify its portfolio with a series of fresh models everything from Taco Bells first drive-thru Cantina in Danville California to some 1000 bellhops across the US by summer\\nNothing was more headline grabbing though than the Go Mobile unit previewed in August 2020 This store has a dual drive-thru is just 1325 square feet compared to 2500 and presents a synchronized digital experience through smart kitchen technology integrated with Taco Bells app The store can detect when guests arrive and suggest the quickest route\\n5\\nWendys\\nWendys had a busy 2020 which wasnt unexpected The company entered the year set on crashing the fast-food breakfast wars And thats exactly what happened in early March Wendys saw its top-line jump 16 percent the first week as breakfast arrived in force We all know what happened next\\nYet for all of the struggles that followed from pulling back marketing contributions to the challenge of serving a daypart in flux Wendys left 2020 with far more positives than negatives Breakfast remained steady at 7 percent of sales in Q1 2021 even as other dayparts strongly increased All of the brands key breakfast metrics improvedsales dollars awareness frequency and customer satisfaction scores\\nThis as awareness levels held around 50 percent With vaccinations increasing and mobility picking up the runway is vast The best predictor of whats to come might be 300 legacy restaurants that offered breakfast prior to Wendys rollout in March 2020 Those stores grew the daypart to more than 10 percent of sales If Wendys can achieve that systemwide as it hopes were talking a 1 billion or so boost\\nOverall Wendys closed 2020 with its two highest global same-store sales quarters in the last 15 years And it kicked 2021 off with a domestic lift of 13 percent or 128 percent on a two-year basis\\n6\\nBurger King\\nLike Starbucks Burger King guided higher US closures than usual in 2020 But also akin to the java leader this was done with portfolio optimization in mind The brand dropped a host of restaurant of the future designs in September 2020 including a suspended kitchen model that sends food down via conveyor belt system\\nAlthough thats a still-to-come initiative parent company Restaurant Brands International continues to upgrade drive-thrus by installing outdoor digital menuboards By the end of 2020 more than 1900 US Burger Kings got the facelift The menuboards also offer the ability to integrate loyalty programs which allow for customized menu items to be displayed based on a guests favorite purchases and redemption history They accommodate loyalty integration through scanning Bluetooth or near-field communication Additionally the flexibility to add immediate remote contactless payment to enable guests to order and pay simultaneously and speed up drive-thru lanes\\nBeyond physical changes Burger King spent much of the past year fine-tuning value The company debuted a 1 Your Way Menu in late December and turned focus to core innovation with promotions and everyday branding customers could expect Or put another way embedded value over fleeting deals\\nIn early January Burger King unveiled a new visual design complete with new logo merchandise uniforms and restaurant signage It marked the companys first complete rebrand in more than two decades\\nMore recently a long-awaited chicken sandwich the ChKing hit markets nationwide and the company promised to turn the dial up on breakfast in 2021 and beyond\\n7\\nDunkin\\nDunkin arguably although theres little debate gave the quick-service world its biggest non-COVID headline of 2020 In mid-December Inspire Brands completed an industry-shaking 113 billion acquisition of the company including Baskin-Robbins With it Inspire which also directs Arbys Jimmy Johns Sonic Drive-In Buffalo Wild Wings and Rusty Taco became the second-largest restaurant company in the US both by system sales and locations despite forming just two years ago\\nRoark Capital-backed Inspire suddenly directed nearly 32000 restaurants across more than 60 countries generating 26 billion in annual system sales\\nThe Dunkin deal was the highest-dollar restaurant deal since 3G Capital LP Burger King Worldwide Inc acquired Tim Hortons for 1264 billion in August 2014 Panera Bread follows at 75 billion a price paid by JAB Holdings in 2017\\nBefore the deal Inspire ran roughly 11000 restaurants At that point there were more than 12500 Dunkin and nearly 8000 Baskin-Robbins globally alone Dunkin was also 100 percent franchised and boasted more than 20000 points of distribution in over 60 countries worldwide\\nThe acquisition represented a 10x premium to that of Sonic and the highest multiple paid for a franchised business of scale in the past 1015 years if not longer BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said at the time\\nWhat this likely signals is future growth as Dunkins price reflects potential as much as current penetration The concept has plenty of runway west of the Mississippi especially in California and previously suggested it could reach 17000 US units in time\\nAhead of the blockbuster Dunkin returned to positive growth in Q3 as its US same-store sales climbed 09 percent But the brand scaled back as it closed 687 domestic locations year-to-date through October including 447 Speedway self-service kiosks\\n8\\nSubway\\nChange is afoot at the worlds largest restaurant chain Subway named former Burger King leader John Chidsey CEO in fall 2019 The following year was a crazy one as we know but major transformation is on deck for Chidsey and the chains revamped leadership\\nFrom a high level expect an overhauled guest experience from core menu changes including chef-recommended builds to 11 new and improved ingredients everything from bread protein and add-ons returning fan-favorites a complete redesign of Subways digital ordering experience and app and new instore merchandising\\nThe exploration of non-traditional locations is on deck too\\nThese changes will run alongside continued retraction as Subways unit count dips The brand exited Walmart stores this past year and will move some of its operations from Milford Connecticut to Miami according to the company\\nSubway had about 23800 US restaurants at the end of 2019\\n9\\nDominos\\nPizza chains across foodservice enjoyed a tailwind from COVIDs clamp on dine-in And Dominos was no different From April 20 to May 17 last year same-store sales lifted 209 percent at US franchises and 22 percent at company-owned stores In the same period domestic retail sales increased 25 percent It also got off to a 134 percent start in 2021 marking the 40th consecutive quarter of growtha run hard to find in any corner of the business\\nThe culprit behind Dominos strong 2020 is no great mystery It entered the year generating 70 percent of its sales through digital channels The number rose to 75 percent ahead of 2021\\nMeanwhile Dominos continues to hold steadfast to its first-party delivery chops and rejection of third-party economics Instead its elected to fortress markets and shrink delivery radiuses as well as capture more carryout Speaking of the latter carryout might be the one area that slid due to COVID Expect that to be a lead goal in 2021 Sales grew in 2020 but order volume weakened The company developed carside delivery as a safer service model but chose to pull the lever back on aggressive marketing That will change as Dominos courts the profitable channel with advertising efforts around carside carryout and moresomething CEO Ritch Allison called a critical weapon moving forward\\n10\\nChipotle\\nChipotles digital investments began well ahead of COVID Pickup shelves A second make-line for off-premises orders The roll out of Chipotlanes The fortuitous strategy skyrocketed the brands digital business in 2020 to video-game levels\\nChipotles digital sales soared to 28 billion in 2020 or a 174 percent boost versus the prior year to 462 percent of total business To illustrate this the companys second make-lines alone generated average-unit volumes of 11 million in 2020\\nTheres reason to believe Chipotle will hold some of the momentum even as dine-in returns Digital sales mix in April held around 50 percent despite the fact all but 20 of the companys restaurants were open with 92 percent of them offering in-restaurant dining with capacity limitations In fact Chipotles digital sales were actually slightly above the COVID peak as it recovered 60 percent of in-restaurant sales In March 2021 Chipotle set a company record for digital transactions supported by its best digital order-ahead month ever Some 800000 people downloaded Chipotles app and the chain served the most new digital customers since May of 2020 Its rewards program also climbed to 21 million customers about 60 percent active It entered 2020 with fewer than 10 million\\nWhile this unfolds Chipotle plans to lean into Chipotlane growth where stores continue to drive 17 percent higher overall digital sales As of March 31 Chipotle boasted a total of 196 stores with order-ahead pickup lanes including five conversions It expects to open roughly 200 new stores this year with more than 70 percent including the feature\\n11\\nSonic Drive-In\\nAs COO Eddie Saroch told QSR earlier in the year Sonic was built for this If any brand was going to satisfy a COVID customer it was going to be the legacy chain with a fleet of drive-thru and drive-in locations And Sonic didnt disappoint The Inspire Brands chain skated to record gains Its average-unit volume was up from 13 million in 2019 to 16 million in 2020 Nearly a quarter of drive-ins the brand said cleared 2 million in AUV last year\\nHowever Sonic didnt just let its store model speak for itself The brand innovated in several key areas including launching the This Is How We Sonic campaign which focused on real families New branding and a fresh logo debuted right before The chain added a tipping function to its mobile app at select stores a full rollout is on deck\\nDigitally Sonics order-ahead app surged to about 11 percent of salesexceeding 540 million in 2020\\nThe company recently added web ordering too\\nPerhaps most vividly though Sonics Delight prototype was revealed last summer and creates a space with multiple service points and bright bold colors Theres a drive-thru 18 drive-in docks that are wider than older models a walk-up window and a covered outdoor patio with string lights and lawn games\\n12\\nPanera Bread\\nPanera entered the pandemic as one of the industrys most-tech forward brands a trailblazer in elements like rewards kiosks and delivery All came into play of course But Panera still managed to get ahead on rising trends One being grocery service which it launched nationwide in April It then decided to start labeling climate-friendly food introduce a new category with flatbread pizza its since expanded to five of","Key Statistics:

ID\\nrampmetrics_last_destination_url\\nrampmetrics_last_landing_page_url\\nrampmetrics_last_person_id\\nrampmetrics_last_referring_url\\nrm_meta_field_one\\nWhen Covid-19 upended the US restaurant industry in March 2020 quick service restaurants or QSRs were hit especially hard Now restaurant industry leaders cant stop thinking about QSR digital transformation or how quick service restaurants are adapting to our new digital-first world \\nAnd for good reason\\nAs of February 2021 restaurants and cafes are still empty sales are declining and stores are closing According to a recent McKinsey report US consumers are expected to spend significantly less money eating out in 2021\\nDespite these changes customers are still interested in takeout delivery drive-thrus and outdoor dining experiences Third-party food sales offered by apps like Uber Eats DoorDash and GrubHub have soared since the pandemic started \\nThe pandemic has prompted consumers to spend more money on food delivery takeout prepared food and groceries trends that we expect to continue even after the pandemic ends Experts also suspect that some diners will be cautious of eating in crowded places for quite some time even after vaccines are rolled out\\nThis means that QSRs must begin preparing for a digital-first future where order ahead and other mobile order experiences will be far more important than they were before the pandemic  \\nHOW QSRS ARE RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC \\nQSRs that rely heavily on brick-and-mortar restaurants tend to have limited loyalty programs like value and family meal promotions legacy platforms and minimal presence on digital and delivery channels Other struggling QSRs dont differentiate themselves enough from key competitors a common problem in industries like financial services\\nBut struggling QSRs still have ample opportunities to stand out among the crowd Thanks to the pandemic QSR customers are looking for 2 qualities in particular when dining out \\n1 Contactless frictionless experiences\\n2 The ability to place online orders in advance\\n90 of customers say they dont want to wait longer than 10 minutes for food ordered via mobile apps And in the QSR world every second counts \\nThe best mobile apps offered by QSRs allow for streamlined curbside pickups mobile order-ahead and cashier-less in-store checkouts Both retailers and customers save time and moneya win-win for all \\nThe good news Mobile order ahead for pickup was growing in popularity faster than delivery even before the pandemic This means that customers were already starting to notice the benefits of ordering ahead with their mobile devices \\nBENEFITS OF ONLINE AND IN-APP ORDERING FOR QSRS\\nQuick service restaurants can boost sales foster brand loyalty and drive revenue by investing in standout mobile ordering experiences\\nSome advantages of mobile ordering for QSRs include\\nFaster transactions\\nHigher average order prices\\nThe ability to display the most popular menu options front and center\\nShowing items based on previous orders\\nGreater customization and personalization\\nPrompt efficient service\\nUpselling\\nIncreased brand loyalty for apps with a standout user experience\\nServing more customers during peak meal times\\nNo long lines even during the lunch and dinner rushes\\nMobile apps can also integrate with wayfinding or geolocation technology as well as inventory management systems tools \\nHOW THE DIGITAL-FIRST MENTALITY WILL IMPACT QSRS AND THEIR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\\nThe digital-first boom and the impact of Covid-19 will have a ripple effect on how QSRs operate for years to come \\nHeres a look at other changes that you can expect over the next few years with the QSR digital transformation\\n1  Quick service restaurants like McDonalds and Subway will continue to change their menus to accommodate for supply chain disruptions and changing customer demand especially for delivery menuswhat people order for in-person dining often varies from what they order for delivery Menu changes can help simplify kitchen operations as well \\n2  Speaking of supply chain disruptions QSRs will continue to track day-to-day operating costs along with food package options disposable paper goods like napkins cleaning products and even spare car parts for QSRs investing in delivery\\n3  Tracking day-to-day operating costs and food-packaging costs will continue to be important For instance oil and chicken are historically cheap right now so QSRs looking to save money can balance their budgets by sweeping up historically low deals\\n4  As in-person eating options dwindle quick service restaurants are doubling down on their digital channels to handle increases in demand QSRs are investing ample resources to improve online ordering experiences on mobile apps and websites \\n5  As part of the QSR digital transformation more restaurants are partnering with call centers delivery aggregators and other third-party services to accommodate surges in demand \\n6  The pandemic has prompted customers to become more concerned with safety and health risks so QSR marketing teams should ensure that hygiene safety and a we-are-all-in-this-together attitude is empathized across all digital channels \\n7  Theres a good chance that QSRs will start investing more resources in delivery drones  robots\\n8  Kiosk ordering which is already popular in European cities airports train stations and elsewhere will continue to become more important in the United States \\n9  As delivery drive thrus and takeout become more important restaurants will be redesigned with less square footage \\n10 Burger King is planning to launch a mobile app feature in Miami and Latin America that allows customers

A recent McKinsey report analyzed how US consumers' spending on dining out is expected to change in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The report provides insights into key statistics, findings, and trends that will impact restaurants and the food service industry. 

Key Statistics and Findings:

- Consumers are projected to spend significantly less on dining out in 2021, with a drop of over 20% compared to pre-pandemic levels.  

- Spending on food delivery, takeout, prepared foods, and groceries is increasing as consumers avoid dining rooms. These shifts are likely to persist after the pandemic.

- Mobile order-ahead for pickup was already growing before COVID-19, showing consumers appreciated the convenience. 90% of customers don't want to wait longer than 10 minutes when using mobile ordering apps.

Trends and Implications: 

In response to increased digital demand, quick service restaurants (QSRs) are investing in mobile apps and improving online ordering experiences. More QSRs are also partnering with third-party call centers and delivery services. Self-service kiosks and new technologies like delivery drones/robots may become more commonplace. With less dine-in demand, restaurants will likely shrink and optimize floorplans for off-premise consumption.

Conclusion:

The pandemic has accelerated existing trends towards off-premise dining. Restaurants must adapt with convenient digital experiences, optimized spaces, and strategic third-party partnerships in order to align with changing consumer preferences.","Introduction:

times easier ordering and tailored experiences Over the past year there have been countless examples where AI and machine learning create efficiencies for operatorsespecially in order-taking Major chains are testing voice or facial recognition and GPS-based push notifications which help resolve labor shortage issues\\n6 Work Reimagined The pandemic ushered in a dramatically different era and permanently altered how employees relate to their employers and their work People are seeking predictable hours schedules and flexibility plus they want to work on things that matter to them and work for an organization aligned with their values\\nAs part of the effort to attract and retain employees employers are focusing on the whole employeeboth mental and physical Nearly half offer mental health benefits like access to a therapist Datassential\\nThe types of jobs available are changing as AI and automation accelerate Quick-service restaurants employees do less food prep and shelf stocking and more specialized work like healthy food preparation and online inventory management Employees are looking to develop their talents and 74 percet of Millennials and Gen Z say they are
