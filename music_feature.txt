Music Feature Implementation Steps:

1. Define the musical elements that will be influenced by the energetic descriptions, such as tempo, melody, harmony, and instrumentation.
2. Map the energetic descriptions to specific musical parameters, considering the intensity, mood, and characteristics of each description.
3. Develop a system or algorithm that translates the energetic descriptions into musical instructions or patterns.
4. Integrate the music feature into the mobile app, providing a user interface for generating the musical composition.
5. Implement the necessary logic and algorithms to generate the musical composition based on the energetic descriptions.
6. Test the music feature by generating compositions for different natal charts and reviewing the results.
7. Refine and adjust the music feature as needed to improve the coherence and musicality of the compositions.
8. Document the music feature implementation for future reference and maintenance.
9. Continuously evaluate and update the music feature based on user feedback and new insights.
