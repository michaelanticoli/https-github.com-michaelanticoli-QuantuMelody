Mobile App Prototype Development Steps:

1. Define the core functionality and features of the app prototype.
2. Break down the development tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Set up the development environment and choose the appropriate programming language and framework.
4. Implement the basic functionality for generating natal charts, including capturing user input, processing the data, and displaying the results.
5. Test the prototype to ensure that the basic functionality is working as expected.
6. Gather feedback from users and stakeholders on the prototype and make necessary adjustments.
7. Iterate on the prototype based on the feedback and refine the functionality and user experience.
8. Continue to test and refine the prototype until it meets the desired level of functionality and usability.
