Feedback Gathering and Improvement Steps:

1. Share the app prototype with a group of testers and gather their feedback.
2. Analyze the feedback received and identify common themes or issues.
3. Prioritize the feedback based on its impact and feasibility of implementation.
4. Make necessary improvements and updates to the app based on the feedback.
5. Conduct additional testing to ensure that the implemented changes have addressed the identified issues.
6. Repeat the feedback-gathering process with a new set of testers to gather more diverse perspectives.
7. Continuously review and update the app based on user feedback to enhance its usability and functionality.
8. Consider implementing a feedback mechanism within the app to gather ongoing feedback from users.
9. Regularly release updates to address user feedback and introduce new features or improvements.
